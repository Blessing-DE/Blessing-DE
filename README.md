# Hey, I’m Blessing 👋

I’ve always been fascinated by stories—stories hidden in numbers, trends, and patterns. That’s why I became a **Data Engineer**. I take messy, chaotic datasets and turn them into something that actually makes sense. Clean, organized, and ready to power decisions.

I spend my days writing **Python scripts that are reusable and reliable**, building **ETL pipelines**, and chasing down those sneaky data issues that no one else notices. I love the feeling when a messy CSV finally clicks into place, or when a pipeline I built just works, every time.

I don’t just process data—I **make it understandable, usable, and meaningful**. From real estate trends to everyday business insights, I enjoy taking raw data and turning it into a story people can actually act on.

Outside of code, I’m obsessed with **finding patterns where others see chaos**. I’m curious, persistent, and a little stubborn—because in data engineering, that’s exactly what you need.

If you’re here, welcome! Stick around, maybe you’ll learn a trick or two about making data work smarter, not harder.
